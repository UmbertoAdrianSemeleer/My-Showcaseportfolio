            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              During my specialization in game design, we received an
              assignment from Games for Health, a non-profit organization
              dedicated to creating health-enhancing games. Our task was to
              work on a game they were developing for Winclove Probiotics.
            </p>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              The assignment focused on improving an existing educational
              multiplayer game called "Mikrolokaal," developed by Games for
              Health for Winclove Probiotics. The primary objective of the
              game is to teach children in grades 7 and 8 about the importance
              of probiotics and healthy living. Here are the key elements of
              the assignment:
            </p>

            <h3>Challenges and Learning Experience</h3>
            <p>
              The game was quite static, lacking interaction, animation,
              sound, and vibrant colorsâ€”it was essentially a series of still
              images moving around. Although it was created in 2D, it was
              positioned to look like a 3D game. Making something both fun and
              educational for kids, who often have short attention spans, is
              particularly challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had to learn animation techniques and study the "12 Principles
              of Animation" guide. I also learned how to add effects and
              structure components in Unity. The game's existing code had no
              comments or explanatory documentation, so we had to figure out
              how it worked on our own.
            </p>

            <h3>Development Process</h3>
            <p>
              For the animations, we made quick paper prototypes with
              stop-motion techniques, created a sandbox environment, and based
              our updates on research about color theory and other relevant
              topics. We then tested the updated game during the "Night of the
              Nerds" event with over 80 kids.
            </p>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
              Typically, the game is controlled by teachers who set the
              difficulty level. However, during playtesting, this approach
              didn't work well. Instead, we let the kids take control, making
              the experience more personal, competitive, and engaging. While
              figuring out the game and its rules, the kids unexpectedly
              learned and taught each other about gut health.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              Getting kids to participate in testing and provide feedback was
              challenging. Bribing them with candy didn't work.
