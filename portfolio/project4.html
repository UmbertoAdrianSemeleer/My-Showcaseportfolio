              <h3>Introduction to the Minor</h3>
              <p>
                During my minor at Embrace TEC, a program at Fontys Pulsed, I participated in a 20-week curriculum integrating technology, entrepreneurship, and creativity. This program deviates from traditional education by employing a challenge-based, student-centered approach using design thinking methodologies.
              </p>

              <h3>Challenge</h3>
              <p>
                One task during my minor was to create a project personal to me. As someone who loves cooking but struggles with dyslexia, I often find online recipes hard to follow. Many websites prioritize SEO, resulting in cluttered, ad-filled content. This inspired me to develop a dyslexia-friendly recipe structure, aiming to make recipes easier to read for myself and others with dyslexia.
              </p>

              <h3>Challenges and Learning Experience</h3>
              <p>
                I had limited knowledge about dyslexia beyond my own experience, so I consulted an expert at ADHD Central. I learned about design principles for dyslexia-friendly materials, including fonts, layouts, colors, and digital accessibility tools.
              </p>

              <h3>Development Process</h3>
              <p>
                I created a paper prototype and pitched it to my teacher. After collecting favorite foods from my classmates, I designed and began coding the prototype. Due to time constraints, I switched to using Wix, a drag-and-drop website builder, and tested it with both dyslexic and non-dyslexic students.
              </p>

              <h3>Outcome</h3>
              <p>
                The feedback from dyslexic users was positive; they appreciated the readability and suggested adding cooking videos and text-to-speech functionality. Non-dyslexic users liked the concept but found the fonts and layouts less appealing, suggesting they could be more visually engaging.
              </p>

              <h3>Reflection</h3>
              <p>
                I learned a great deal about digital accessibility and filtering feedback. Dyslexia-friendly fonts and layouts might not conform to conventional design rules, but they work effectively for their intended audience. I realized the importance of prioritizing functionality and readability over aesthetics to ensure accessibility for all users.
