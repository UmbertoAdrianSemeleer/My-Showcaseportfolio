            <p>The DinoHoops Learning Car is a remote-controlled educational tool designed for Primary School De Driestam. It features a car with a T-Rex skin, a basketball hoop, and colorful lights and sounds that activate when kids score a point.

            <h3>MDMA Impact Jenga</h3>
            <p>It is an educational game designed to raise awareness about the consequences of MDMA use. Using the familiar Jenga game format, players interact with two stacks of blocks representing their health and emotional state before and after MDMA use. Dice rolls dictate block removal, introducing instability and symbolizing the drug's effects. Players must also draw from a black box containing deformed blocks, representing the unpredictable and often harmful symptoms of MDMA use. The game serves as a conversation starter to highlight the risks and unpredictable nature of MDMA use..</p>

            <p>This project involved improving an educational multiplayer game called "Mikrolokaal" for Games for Health, a non-profit focused on creating health-enhancing games. The game, originally developed for Winclove Probiotics, aims to educate children in groups 7 and 8 about the importance of gut bacteria and probiotics. Designed for tablet use in a classroom setting, it accommodates up to 15 participants and requires one moderator to host the session. The primary goal is to raise awareness and educate children on the benefits of probiotics and healthy living.</p>
