            <h3>Hey There,
              Iâ€™m 
              Umberto</h3>
            <p>A UI UX Designer, game design and front end developer.Worked in multiple projects loyalty programs, referral programs ,educational games. I am also Certified elctricatian and kool montuer.</p>
            <p>
              
I am dedicated to bringing ideas to life through design, coding, and other mediums. My journey in the tech world began with a curiosity about how things work. I love solving complex problems and crafting creative solutions that not only meet user needs but also exceed their expectations.
When I'm not studying or working on projects, you can find me exploring new technologies. I have a diverse range of interests beyond ICT, including cooking, tinkering with electronics, gardening, and exploring different workshops to learn new skills. I enjoy continuously learning new things.
I originally come from Aruba, where I worked as an electrician for a few years. I moved to the Netherlands to further my education in electrical engineering. During my studies, I was introduced to programming and found it intriguing, leading me to pursue it further at Fontys ICT. My goal is to help people in society who are less able, including those who are neurodivergent, dyslexic, autistic, or disabled. I believe that access to information should be available to everyone and that everyone should have the opportunity to learn or participate. Many people in the world think and process things differently, and I want to give those people a chance.
Let's connect and create something amazing together!
