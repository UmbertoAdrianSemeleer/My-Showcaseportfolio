              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                This project was our introductory assignment in game design, aimed at familiarizing ourselves with the fundamental concepts of game design and the Unity game development platform. The objective was to create a simple first-person shooter (FPS) game.
              </p>

              <h3>Challenge</h3>
              <p>
                We brainstormed on a whiteboard and conducted research on existing FPS games, eventually coming up with the concept of "Sun Killer." We consolidated our ideas into a Game Design Document and created paper prototypes, making adjustments based on our findings. One of the main challenges was the limited time frame which prevented us from fully realizing our game concept.
              </p>

              <h3>Challenges and Learning Experience</h3>
              <p>
                I focused on environment design, the first-person controller, and player health scripts. Although I was new to scripting in C#, my partner, a software student, guided me through the process. This project provided a significant learning experience, especially in overcoming the steep learning curve associated with Unity and C# scripting.
              </p>

              <h3>Development Process</h3>
              <p>
                After finalizing our game concept, we moved into the development phase. We created the game environment and implemented core mechanics such as the first-person controller and player health. Throughout this process, we regularly tested our game, making adjustments based on feedback and our own observations. After development, we conducted a playtest, observing players and taking notes. We also had them complete a survey to validate our game.
              </p>

              <h3>Outcome</h3>
              <p>
                The outcome was a functional game featuring a boss fight. However, due to time constraints, we were unable to add proper sounds to the game, which impacted the overall experience.
              </p>

              <h3>Reflection</h3>
              <p>
                This project was a valuable introduction to game design and development. It highlighted the importance of time management and iterative testing. Despite not being able to fully realize our vision, the experience was educational and provided a strong foundation for future projects in game design.
